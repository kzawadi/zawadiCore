   [![Codemagic build status](https://api.codemagic.io/apps/6149c2552d7e14cfd442757c/6149c2552d7e14cfd442757b/status_badge.svg)](https://codemagic.io/apps/6149c2552d7e14cfd442757c/6149c2552d7e14cfd442757b/latest_build)

   <h3> The Goals </h3>

=> To unify the design of all widgets and little components to athere to a single design language       

=> Make sure the result App are layed out perfectly in all screen sizes (Tablets,Desktops,Web,  handheld<normal phones> and foldables)

=> The Custom layout doesn't depend on device type it depend on actualy current given display sizes
   meaning if its a web App and the tab get rised then it will react to those changes 



   <h3>  Extreme Lab </h3>

Current this unified Design system isn't tied to any architecture design 

But in order to create a very good DevOps flow and make it easier i am thinking of using the MVC type of architecture to add more robustness.

The goal is simple any one utilizing this Design system to have a consistency UI elements implementation across all aspects of the App.

   <h3> Up coming </h3>

   CI/CD  continuas intergration and deployments
